## Description
"Faugei - Flower Shop" is a responsive website project created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project was a graded assignment for the [Complete Web Development Course](https://web.programming-hero.com/course-details) offered by Programming Hero. The project involved recreating a website provided on Figma while also incorporating a challenge section of my own. It's worth noting that the project received full marks, demonstrating the successful implementation of the required features and design.
